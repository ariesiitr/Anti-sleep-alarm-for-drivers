# Anti-sleep-alarm-for-drivers
In this project I have made a prototype of Anti-sleep alarm device fpor drivers, which I have simulated in Tinkecad.
https://www.tinkercad.com/things/h3nUHQaxxER-anti-sleep-alarm/editel
The purpose of this project is simple to avoid accidents during driving, as in our country most of the accidents occur due the drowsiness of drivers.
This device will actually detect the drowsiness of drivers and give alarm to wake up.<br/>

## Materials Required: -
1. Breadboard: - For assembling the IR sensor, Relay board, Motor, and Arduino UNO.<br/>

2. Arduino Uno with cable: - The main brain of the circuit, operated when a code is uploaded using Arduino IDE software.<br/>

## MAKING_PROTOTYPE_OF_DEVICE
  For making such device we need to interface all the required equipments as shown in figure: -

Now write the Code and upload it in Arduino UNO using Arduino IDE Software.
